   <p><img src="res/media.jpg"></p>
    
    <p>
     This results to the unjust control of media contents springing to biases as standards of advertisers will only be considered for media content programs. Additionally, advertisers’ public relations nowadays are also invalidating the believability of media because instead of airing interesting and notable news publicity materials are more entertained and contemplated this results to more relevant news expulsion from unimportant publicity materials airing, for example covid-19 news was barely featured in news during the starting months of 2020 until it shocked the public for the reports of public health care about the increasing cases of infection and mortality..</p>


      <p>Therefore, pressure on professional journalists to cover and unfold more informative news and stories arise . Lastly, advertisers television content are seen to be impacted by many factors and concepts. Ethical issues are being seen in the advertisements presented in television as it triggers either materialism, commercialism and colonial mentality. Actions must be done here ethical principles of media must always be met to avoid misleading people from what’s moral and immoral. </p>

  <p><img src="res/world.jpg"></p>
  
  <p>Since Mass Media plays the role of releasing news, public announcements and mass email, it caters the needs of the majority. Nonetheless, the decentralization of Mass Media and the establishments of community media highlights the availability of media anytime and anywhere. </p>
  
  <p>Community Media is inclusive as it allows people from remote areas, indigenous and trival groups to incorporate themselves in community issues and programs for development. Data, program contents and stories are all free from profitable manipulation. </p>
