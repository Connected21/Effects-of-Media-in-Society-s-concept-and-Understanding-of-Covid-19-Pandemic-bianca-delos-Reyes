    <h2>The role of social media during a Pandemic</h2>
    
    
    <p>Media has always been a vital part of the society, it can mean life and death to so many specially in this trying times. Covid-19 has become a pandemic and global medical issue up until this moment. It has the possibility of inflicting all humanity if not addressed and suppressed properly. </p>
    
    
   <p><img src="res/dis.jpg"></p>
    
    <p>
     Access to media has been very necessary in the midst of this pandemic as it somehow save lives  from the threat of massive virus infliction. Additionally, Media has been a useful tool in disseminating useful and essential information about any news, entertainment or in this case, any updates about COVID-19.</p>


      <p>It serves as the channel of people to keep updated and mindful. Specifically speaking, mass media impacts the people’s awareness and preparedness for it is responsible for the deliverance of safety precautions, tips, quarantine policies, quarantine facilities, mortality rate, death rate and even the updates of aiming at curve-flattening.</p>

      <p>Media facilitates change among the members of the nation as all media personnel are expected to spearhead and front-lined this medical crisis alongside with medical experts and public service centered people. Hunger for information, news and public services are served by the media jointly with the government. Media are expected to disperse and broadcast more updates Especially now that the "new normal" is fast approaching; where everyone in today’s time are required to wear face masks and observe social distancing.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the implementation of community quarantines around the country to restrict people from going out and reminding them to always stay indoors for their safety and protection. Innovations in human interaction are also encouraged parallel with the advent of technology and platforms discoveries such as zoom meetings which allows office employees to continue their work, students to study and even event celebrations, business meetings and worshipping practices to still be continued at home. Moreover, media not only has it eased everyone into ignorance during the world wide quarantine , it also had opened a lot of opportunities to have a wide and broader discussion about politics and the like. Where it has been a site where Filipinos are speaking up for their rights to be heard, to let every unaware citizens hear their thoughts about the discomposed and unorganized government and their plan of action for covid-19 full elimination.</p>

      <p>Media particularly social media made everybody enlightened of everything that’s happening in the midst of this pandemic. However, it is doubtlessly a truth that  misleading information and misinformation alarms people so much to the extent that it causes so much stress and anxiety to them.</p>

      <p>Disinformation and misinformation are worsening the situation instead of prompting to clampdown covid-19 it causes panic and apprehension among people. Recently,  panic and excessive buying has been reported and various protocols were issued to restrict unrestrained shopping of basic grocery items such as canned goods, bread, coffee etc. Now that everyone almost can gain media particulars, discernment of what’s real and unreal is crucial.
